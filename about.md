My name is Bastian David and I am a Data Scientist, Computational Neuroscientist and AI Engineer.
My background is interdisciplinary and I am super enthusiastic about all things Data! Therefore, I worked in dozens of different research areas e.g.: 
* autonomous robots 
* a wheelchair controlled by brain waves only
* predicting football player metrics
* brain stimulation techniques 
* assisting radiologists and neurologists using AI/Deep Learning
* Neuroeconomic research

Methodologically I am utilizing current AI techniques, such as convolutional neural networks, graph neural networks and generative adversarial networks. However, I am not limited to AI methodology and try to make analytical choices based on pragmatism.

Besides data analysis, I am very driven by the prospect of using creative data analyses to have a positive influence on people's lives and, ultimately, our society as a whole.
