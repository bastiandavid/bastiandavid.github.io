# Welcome!
Welcome to my personal homepage!

I am a Computational Neuroscience PhD student at the University Hospital Bonn,
Department of Epileptology. I am trying to develop clinically viable software tools
to help physicians diagnose and surgically treat their patients.

This homepage is still very fresh and a big work-in-progress.
