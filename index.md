# Welcome to my personal homepage!

<img class="indeximg" src="/assets/brain_combi.png">

I am a Computational Neuroscience PhD student at the University Hospital Bonn,
Department of Epileptology. I am developing clinically viable software
based on state-of-the-art artificial intelligence methodology
to help physicians diagnose and surgically treat their patients.

This website is still a work in progress, in case you are interested in my current projects,
feel free to checkout my [publications](http://www.bastiandavid.com/publications/) or
