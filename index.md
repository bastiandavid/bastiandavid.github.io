# Welcome!
Welcome to my personal homepage!

I am a Computational Neuroscience PhD student at the University Hospital Bonn,
Department of Epileptology. I am trying to develop clinically viable software tools
to help physicians diagnose and surgically treat their patients.

This homepage is still very fresh and a big work-in-progress. For now, I recommend you to
check out our [Lab-Homepage](https://www.translationalneuroimaging.de/bonn) to find out
more about the exciting projects we're all working on. But please come back another time!
